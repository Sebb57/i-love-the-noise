I LOVE THE NOISE !
trying to make a small project to discover js and websocket, i want to do a basic page with rooms and possibility to play annoying noises to each other in separate rooms.

to run locally you'll need python and npm, then just do this:
(python is probably not the best option but its how i know how to do it)
```bash
npm install
make start
```
make sure you have nothing on port 8080 and 8081 (i'll probably make some util tools to change them easilly)
the main page is by default on the 8081

to stop it the clean/easy way:
```bash
make stop
```
