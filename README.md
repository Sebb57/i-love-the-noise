I LOVE THE NOISE !
trying to make a small project to discover js and websocket, i want to do a basic page with rooms and possibility to play annoying noises to each other in separate rooms.

if you want to try it out feel free to [here](https://sebb57.github.io/i-love-the-noise/) ! Since it's pretty light and wont host a lot of traffic i can host the server for free and use github pages for the main page.
